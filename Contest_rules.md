# Arena Contest Rules - Micro-Bots Collecting Balls
## Preparatory Test: 1 bot
the micro-bot is **alone** in the area of 1.30m x 1.30m, **25 balls** are available.  
It must collect a maximum of balls in 2 minutes.

This first score will provide a ranking for event 2. The order will be given by:
1. time to collect the 25 balls
1. or number of balls collected in 2 minutes,
1. or time to collect the 1st ball.

## Contest with 2 Arenas of 2 Bots
**Two micro-bots** face off in an arena measuring 1.30 m x 1.30 m, with a total of **25 balls**.  
Two arenas are in operation simultaneously, and each cycle lasts 4 minutes.

## Contest with 4 bots
**Four micro-bots** racing together in a doubled size arena 1.30mx2.60m, **50 balls**.
4 minutes par cycle.


# Score calculation
## Per cycle:
Score Calculation by cycle (2 bots and 4 bots)
### Bonus (points):
- +2 points for each ball owned (i.e., present in the bot's zone at the end of the cycle).
- +10 points for the participant in the arena who has the most balls present in their zone.
- +5 points for those who have at least as many balls as half the number of balls of the first place.
- +5 points for the 2 participants in the arena who total the most balls owned (event with 2 bots only).
- +5 points for securing within 15 seconds.
- +5 points if the number of balls collected matches the information transmitted at the end of the cycle.

### Malus (penalties):
- Number of seconds taken to reach the safe zone upon receiving an alert (beyond 20 seconds, maximum penalty: -10 points).
- Difference between the number of balls actually collected and the last information from the bot (maximum penalty: -5 points).

## After all cycles
- Final calculation of energy performance ranking (= balls collected / distance traveled in dm)
    - 1st: +50 points
    - 2nd: +35 points
    - 3rd: +15 points
